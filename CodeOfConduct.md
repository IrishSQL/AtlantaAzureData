# Atlanta Azure Data - Code of Conduct

The Atlanta Azure Data User Group consists of Data Professionals interested in using the Microsoft Data Platform.  Our purpose is to provide a forum for the Data Professionals of Atlanta to network, communicate and educate one another.
Our user group is open to both technical and business-minded professionals.  We are database experts who passionately share our knowledge with the community. However, it’s not enough to be an outstanding technologist, we also want to represent our values and display community spirit in a positive way by conducting ourselves with respect and restraint whenever we engage with others within and outside the community. Simply put, an individual’s character and leadership truly matter.
  

### Code of Conduct for leaders and attendees

As event and experience organizers, we seek to provide a **respectful, friendly, professional experience for everyone, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, age, race, or religion**. We do not tolerate any behavior that is degrading to any gender, race, sexual orientation, or disability, nor do we tolerate any behavior that would be deemed harassment or discrimination. Individuals are responsible for knowing and abiding by our standards and we encourage everyone to assist in creating a safe and welcoming environment.

Please report any concerns, suspicious activity, or disruptive behavior to the Atlanta Azure Data team so we can address issues immediately.

### All group members should abide by the following:

### During any event, meeting or presentation

* **Respect the presenter and other attendees**

* **No disrespectful behavior.** This includes threats, harassment, stalking, abuse, slurs, profanity, personal attacks, sexual remarks or innuendos, physical violence, public speculation about others, and any other behavior that you would not tolerate others display towards you.

* Refrain from carrying on conversations during the presentation. If conversation is necessary, please leave the presentation room

* Ask questions but respect the presenter’s wishes regarding when to ask questions (some like questions during the presentation, others have specific Q&A time slots). Also, give others a chance to ask questions. If you have more than one question, give others a chance to pose theirs before you ask your next question.

* Don’t challenge the presenter on a point during the presentation. If you feel that the presenter’s information is completely incorrect or off base, signal one of the user group leaders, leave the room to present your information, and allow the user group leader to deal with it. Asking a question that might lead to clarification is one thing, directly disagreeing with the presenter leads to embarrassment of the presenter and confusion for other attendees.

* Avoid asking questions or making statements that will side-track the presentation. However it’s intended, it may be seen as hijacking the presentation.

### At all times

* **No impersonations** of a Microsoft or user group employee, agent, manager, host, or another user.

* **No illegal or offensive activities.** Members will not publish, post, distribute, or disseminate defamatory, infringing, obscene, or other unlawful material or discussion in any group forum or post. This includes, but is not limited to, child pornography, bestiality, incest, illegal drugs, software piracy, discriminatory/racist statements or images and harassment.

* **Accountability.** Members are fully responsible and liable for anything they say (whether orally or in writing) or do. This includes any actions taken based on advice or information received in presentations, online forums or elsewhere. Remember, always test what you plan to do, regardless of the source of the information.

* **No libel or slander** against the user group, Microsoft or other persons or entities. Libel includes false statements made in written form, such as statements posted to forums or other publicly accessible websites, electronic mail, or any other printed form.

* **No confidentiality violations.** Members may inadvertently gain access to certain non-public information during their participation in the group and are expected to honor the confidentiality of the information.

* **No plagiarism.** Members may post their own original work or work that they have written permission to post. If a member cites another author’s work, please provide any necessary attribution according to the requirements associated with the original author’s work.

* **No discrimination or harassment.** This user group is committed to providing a harassment-free experience to members regardless of age, ancestry, color, gender identity or expression, marital status, medical condition, national origin, physical size, physical or mental disability, political affiliation, veteran status, race, religion, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, or technology choices. Harassment is unwelcome verbal, physical or virtual behavior based on the characteristics identified above.

* **No sexual harassment.** Sexual harassment is unwelcome verbal, physical or virtual behavior based on sex and includes gender-based harassment of a person of the same or different gender. Examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to:

* Unwelcome sexual advances

* Sexual comments or inappropriate gender-based jokes

* Excessive, unwelcome romantic attention

* Offering or conditioning an employment benefit or preferential treatment, like a promotion or job assignment, in exchange for sexual favors

* Unwelcome physical contact

* Sharing or displaying sexually explicit content

* Using sexually degrading words

We reserve the right to take action equal and commensurate with the violation. This includes ejecting any participants who violate our Code of Conduct from the event and prohibiting attendance at all future user group associated events.

### Reporting Conduct Violations

If you become aware of a conduct violation on or offline, you are encouraged to report it to a user group leader.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a user group leader or member of the event staff immediately.
